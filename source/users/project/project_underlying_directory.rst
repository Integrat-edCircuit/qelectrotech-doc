=================================
Open project underlying directory
=================================

QElectroTech provides the feature of opening the directory where a opened project was saved from the user interface, 
without the need to look for the directory locally.

To open the underlying directory of a project:

1. Right click on the opened `project`_ from which the underlying directory is desired from the `projects panel`_ tree.
2. Select **Open the underlying directory** to open the local directory where the `project`_ was saved.

   If the `projects panel`_ is not displayed, it can be displayed from **Settings > Display > Projects**.
